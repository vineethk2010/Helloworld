Hello fellow beings..
here is a java program i've been working on, its to convert number to words. i have managed to convert upto 9,223,372,036,854,775,806 
(Nine Quintillion Two Hundred Twenty Three Quadrillion Three Hundred Seventy Two Trillion Thirty Six Billion Eight Hundred Fifty Four Million Seven Hundred Seventy Five Thousand Eight Hundred Six). the limit that a "long" data-type can hold. 
Is there any other way to implement much higher numbers like say a googolplex.
